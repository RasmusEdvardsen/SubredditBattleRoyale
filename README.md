# SubredditBattleRoyale

[![Frontend & Backend Azure CI](https://github.com/RasmusEdvardsen/SubredditBattleRoyale/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RasmusEdvardsen/SubredditBattleRoyale/actions/workflows/main.yml)

SubredditBattleRoyale is a battle royale token for subreddits to flex on each other, or for people to secure the void will win against subreddits. When a winner is found, a new and harder season is started.

![architecture](architecture.drawio.svg)

## Game summary
* Start with 1_000_000 tokens. They cost 0.0001 ether to purchase. 
* Tokens should be inscribed with a subreddit. It should always start with "/r/" followed by no less than one character.
* A "season" is won, when a subreddit has more tokens than "the void". After that, a new season starts. Old tokens still count, but new tokens are minted for the new season.
* You can also burn tokens, which will burn amount 3 times the amount of tokens of the specified subreddit.

## Future ideas (**Clean up this mess**)
* Look in to ERC20 tokens. Voting sessions for owners, or something like that?
* Consider Solana as a blockchain, and figure out equivalent of ERC-20 standard token for Solana.
* Should configure CORS on backend thru az cli deploy script, and same for backend URI env var for frontend.
* Check for wallet on mobile as well somehow. If possible, then show in architecture diagram.
* [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), make frontend pretty (and reactive to purchases and burns)
* Get token price and burn multiplier from blockchain, persist to backend, show in frontend
* If succesful, host with app-service or static web app or whatever that allows 'https://subredditbattleroyale.com' as domain name (static website only allows subdomains)

## Progress
* [Frontend](https://battleroyale.z16.web.core.windows.net/)
* [Backend](https://subredditbattleroyale.azurewebsites.net/api/GetEvents)

## TODO
- [x] read the [ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
- [x] read about [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)
- [x] [hardhat ignition](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview)
- [x] [hardhat verifying deploys](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying)
- [x] Try deploy Lock.sol to testnet
- [x] Read up on [how to interact with smart contracts](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/how-to-interact-with-smart-contracts#interacting-with-smart-contracts)
- [x] Try calling Lock.sol on testnet?
- [x] Work on SubredditBattleRoyalesol
- [x] Create tests for SubredditBattleRoyale.sol
- [x] Figure out how to handle casing (subreddits are case insensitive right?)
- [x] Figure out max subreddit length
- [x] Test that _startNewSeason increases linearly over time, and that successive wins can occur
- [x] Test that successive withdrawals can occur
- [x] Add remaining folders/files from hardhat boilerplate
- [x] Find rivaling subreddits, init contract with unequal amounts of coins to incentivize usage (add test for this) (heavy on crypto/tech sites).
- [x] Allow the owner to adjust the burn multiplier as part of seasonal settings.
- [x] Deploy to testnet
- [x] Test that eth/gwei are sent to owner wallet, and that I have control over it (configure wallet during build/deploy to go to mine)
- [x] **(MAYBE)** optimize _toLowerCase, or require in validation somehow?
- [x] Deploy Lock.sol to mainnet
- [x] Lower optimization all the way down for cheaper deployment
- [x] Deploy to live
- [x] Read up on the [web3.js](https://docs.web3js.org/) for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain (maybe also [ethers library](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/))
- [x] Buy 'subredditbattleroyale.com' domain
- [x] Try withdrawing from the contract, and purchase more tokens afterwards
- [x] Read up on: [getting started](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/getting-started/), [abi encoding](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-abi-encoding/), [log streaming](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-subscriptions-streaming/)
- [x] Add backend for blockchain events (logs). When frontend requests data, get new events since last block in db from blockchain and persist to db, then send to frontend.
- [x] Create frontend: [web3.js](https://docs.web3js.org/), [ethers library](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/), [hardhat boilerplate project](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/boilerplate-project), [web3 example app](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3js-example-react-app/tree/main/src)
- [x] Figure out how to call smart contract seamlessly (purchasing, burning, withdrawing)
- [x] Create diagram to show how blockchain, backend, database, frontend and wallet communicates
- [x] github actions CI/CD for web app: [tutorial](https://johanrin.com/posts/deploy-react-app-in-azure-storage-and-static-web-apps/)
- [x] github actions CI/CD for api azure functions set contractAddress & alchemyApiKey through github actions as az func app settings variables
- [x] Add box around backend & frontend which illustrates they're hosted in azure (and maybe try make the diagram [online](draw.io)?)
- [x] setup DNS for frontend (and maybe backend as well?) (this didn't age well lol)
- [x] sync void tokens from backend to frontend as well
- [x] hook up frontend to backend (sync events), set CORS so only frontend can hit API
- [x] Implement burnTokens
- [x] refresh from backend every N seconds (add loading state) (setInterval?)
- [x] Add d3.js to frontend
- [x] Add 'Browser' to Browser box in architecture diagram
- [x] burn/purchase tokens number picker
- [x] Add a text detailing the rules of subreddit battle royale
- [x] fix layout (bubblecloud take all horizontal space, use flex for other things) (comment out all css, then add back in iteratively)
- [x] Make "connect", "purchase" and "burn" buttons prettier
- [x] Create AI Logo (favicon.ico)
- [x] Ads/marketing: google ads
- [x] Ads/marketing: reddit ads
- [x] delete subredditbattleroyale storage account from azure
- [x] Remove reddit and google ads
- [ ] Debug backend, add app insights logging, add rate limiting (?)
